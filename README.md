# Strategy

I use tuples as objects and elements of tuples as the property of the object (like sampleId, health, costs, and etc.). I use lists that contain these tuples to collect them. <br/>
I choose the sample (best sample) with the highest health value. The robot goes to the diagnosis module and connects to this sample. 
Then it goes to molecules module and takes the molecules as much as the sample needs. And finally, it goes to the laboratory
module and gives the molecules to the module.
